# Color Contrast Checker

## Description

The [**Color Contrast Checker**](https://contrast.mateusvillain.com/) is a simple and practical tool for validating color contrast accessibility in websites and applications. Based on the **WCAG** (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines), the project allows you to check whether the contrast between text and background colors meets the recommended readability and accessibility standards for people with visual impairments.

This project was inspired by the [Colour Contrast Checker](https://colourcontrast.cc/).

### What it does:
- Evaluates the contrast between background and text colors.
- Informs whether the contrast meets the guidelines set by WCAG.
- Helps developers and designers create more inclusive and accessible interfaces.

### Advantages:
- **Ease of use**: Simple and fast interface to validate contrast.
- **Accessibility**: Helps ensure your project adheres to web accessibility best practices.
- **Based on WCAG**: Follows the guidelines established by WCAG to ensure your colors meet recommended contrast standards.

## WCAG Guidelines

The **WCAG** (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) is a set of guidelines created to improve the accessibility of web content, including text, images, and other visual components.

### Contrast Guidelines:
- **Level AA**: The minimum contrast ratio between text and background is **4.5:1** for normal text and **3:1** for large text.
- **Level AAA**: For higher accessibility, the contrast should be **7:1** for normal text and **4.5:1** for large text.

These levels are designed to ensure that people with visual impairments (such as color blindness) or low vision can read and interact with web content without difficulty.

- **HTML**: Structuring and marking up the interface.
- **CSS**: Styling the interface and responsive layout.
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: For the logic and front-end interactions of the tool.
